# Calculator-UX
A responsive, multi-page calculator web application (built with [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/ "Bootstrap")) focused on enhanced user experience, accessibility, and visual theming. **Calculator-UX** provides multiple calculation tools (arithmetic, BMI, and geometric shapes) wrapped in a consistent, accessible UI with light/dark modes, responsive navigation, and modular JavaScript architecture.

## Setup Instructions
#### 1. Clone the Repository:
Enter the following in command line:

```
git clone https://github.com/vkumar-2/Calculator-UX.git
cd Calculator-UX
```

#### 2. Open in VS Code:
Navigate to `File > Open Folder` in **VS Code**, and select the folder **Calculator-UX**. Then open the file **index.html**.

**3. Optional - Live Server / Node.js:**<br>

## Features
### Tech Stack:
- **Bootstrap** - main framework used for creating responsive layouts and consistent UI components.

- **ES6 modules** - use of `import` and `export` for accessibility and applying theme logic (light/dark mode).
- **Font Awesome** - enhanced UI/UX of the application, aesthetics and improves accessibility cues, e.g. icons.

### UI/UX Designs:
- **Arithmetics** - performs basic mathematics - add, subtract, multiply, divide.
- **Geometrics** - calculate the area/perimeter of 2D shapes and the volume of 3D shapes.
- **BMI** - calculates and displays a chart of Body Mass Index.
- **Accessibility** - high contrast themes (light/dark mode) and keyboard-friendly navigation.
